Add code that exits the fdisk wrapper script with the same exit code as real fdisk
Check if fdisk's stderr still gets written to stderr through my script
Check how LVM logical volumes get handled
	In imitate_fdisk mode - is it the same as regular fdisk?
	In non imitate_fdisk mode - can I have it only show lvm disks if fdisk is new enough to handle LVM?
Test code on:
	CentOS
	Debian
	Alpine
My "check if loop device looks like it has a partition table" code in install.sh applies to all types of disks - not just loop devices, which is bad
	Fix it
	Test fix in a VM
Add instructions for installing fdisk script manually in cases where install.sh fails
	Ex. Embeded systems without tools like fmt, tput, and other small programs I don't test for
Go over all the code before I merge into master

ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU CHANGE get_list_of_devices IN ONE FILE (fdisk or install.sh), YOU DO IT IN THE OTHER TOO!
